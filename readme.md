## Knight's Tour Problem

This repository contains an implementation of the Knight's Tour problem. The Knight's Tour is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, where a knight must visit every square on a chessboard exactly once. This implementation includes both open and closed tours and utilizes Warnsdorf's rule to optimize the tour. The board dimensions are dynamic and can be adjusted.

# Features

Open Tour: The knight visits every square exactly once and does not end on the starting square.

Closed Tour: The knight visits every square exactly once and ends on the starting square.

Warnsdorf's Rule: A heuristic to reduce the number of decisions
the knight has to make by always moving to the square with the fewest onward moves.

# Dynamic Board Dimensions: The size of the chessboard can be adjusted to any
